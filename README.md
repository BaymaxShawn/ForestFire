## Introduction 
Forest fires have been one of the most essential factors which lead to property loss and environment damage in North America. A great deal of manpower and material resources have been put into fighting the forest fires, however, the problem still remains
severe and brings great harm to the natural environment.

Therefore, prevention and control of forest fires become even more important
and a lot of valuable data has been gathered to analyze the potential reasons and
affecting existing factors in the formation of forest fires.

By executing data mining and data analysis on this problem, our team aims to find potential reasons for forest fires in North America by analyzing the degree of correlation between existing factors and forest fires. After that, we summarized the findings and elaborated potential implications as well as possible improvements by combining the analysis results with the actual situation.
